/*
 * updater.js -- in-app updates for a Quartz that was installed from source (a git clone).
 *
 * Pure Node: no Electron in here, so tests/updater-test.js drives every path with throwaway git
 * repos and a fake fetch. updater-main.js wires it to the app (IPC, the timer, the restart) and
 * updater-chrome.js draws it (the card in the corner, and the Updates rows in Settings > About).
 *
 * WHERE A RELEASE COMES FROM. GitHub Releases of the public repo: an unauthenticated
 *   GET {apiBase}/repos/{owner}/{repo}/releases/latest
 * with the last ETag in If-None-Match, so an unchanged answer is a 304 and costs almost nothing.
 * A rate-limited answer (403/429 with no requests left, or Retry-After) is said as such and the
 * next check waits for GitHub's reset time. Owner, repo, the API base and fetch are injectable.
 *
 * WHEN AN UPDATE COUNTS AS AVAILABLE. Only when the release's tag commit is NOT already in HEAD:
 * the tag is fetched, then `git merge-base --is-ancestor <tag> HEAD`. A folder at or ahead of the
 * release is never prompted.
 *
 * WHEN THE UPDATE BUTTON IS OFFERED. Every one of these must hold; otherwise the user is told
 * exactly which did not, and shown the commands to update by hand:
 *   - the app folder is a normal git clone (a linked worktree, where .git is a file, never checks);
 *   - its origin is the public repo;  - it is on the default branch;
 *   - tracked files have no uncommitted changes;  - it is not a shallow clone;
 *   - a fast-forward to the tag is possible;
 *   - when the release changes the dependencies (package.json or package-lock.json beyond their
 *     version fields): npm and node are on PATH;
 *   - the release tag is signed by a key in release-signers AS INSTALLED HERE, and names exactly the
 *     commit the update merges (see "signed release tags" below). A copy with no key yet says so.
 *
 * WHAT UPDATE DOES.
 *   1. Downloading: fetch the tag again and re-check every condition above.
 *   2. Installing: only when the dependencies changed (see depsChanged), `npm ci` runs in a
 *      STAGING copy of the release (<app>\.quartz-update\tree, exported from git without touching
 *      the index). It cannot run in place: Windows will not delete node_modules\electron\dist while
 *      Quartz is running from it, and npm ci starts by deleting node_modules. This is the step that
 *      can take minutes (it downloads the castlabs Electron the release pins), and the progress
 *      text says so. Without new dependencies: `git merge --ff-only <tag>` here and now.
 *   3. Restarting: through Quartz's normal quit path, so the session and tabs restore. When new
 *      dependencies were staged, a small helper (runSwap below, run by node from PATH) waits for
 *      Quartz to exit, THEN runs `git merge --ff-only <tag>` and swaps the staged node_modules in,
 *      and starts Quartz again. Until Quartz has quit, the app folder is untouched.
 *
 * IF ANYTHING FAILS. `git reset --keep <old sha>`; a staged node_modules is thrown away (the live
 * one was never touched, so there is nothing to reinstall); the swap helper renames the old
 * node_modules back. Quartz stays on the old version and says why, with the log's path. Never a
 * half-updated install.
 *
 * AN INSTALLED COPY (opts.installed: Quartz-Setup.exe put it in its own folder, see install-mode.js).
 *   There is no git folder, so nothing above applies except the check itself: the same releases
 *   API, the release counts as available when its version is newer than package.json's, and the
 *   state carries `download`, the installer's stable link, in place of an Update button. update()
 *   refuses with the reason. Running the new installer over this copy is the update.
 *
 * NEVER SILENT. Every state carries a sentence: why there is no check (off), why a check failed,
 * why there is no button, why an update failed and where its log is.

/*
 * A release is installed only when its tag is signed by a key listed in release-signers AS IT IS IN
 * THE COPY ALREADY INSTALLED. That file is read from the app folder before anything is fetched, and
 * the fetched release's own copy is never consulted, so a release can never vouch for itself: a new
 * key only counts once a release signed by an old key has put it there (tools/RELEASING.md).
 *
 * Git does the cryptography: `git verify-tag` with gpg.format=ssh hands the signature to
 * `ssh-keygen -Y verify` with the allowed-signers file, so no GPG install is needed. That takes git
 * 2.34 or newer and OpenSSH 8.2 or newer; Git for Windows and Windows 11's own OpenSSH both qualify.
 * Every setting the check depends on is passed on the command line (format, signers file, program,
 * minimum trust), so the user's own git config can neither weaken it nor send it elsewhere.
 *
 * A good signature is not enough on its own: the signed tag object is read back and must name
 * exactly the commit the update merges, as a commit, under the release's own tag name. An old signed
 * tag re-published under a new name, or a signed tag that peels to some other commit, is refused.
 *
 * Bootstrap. Copies from before signing existed have no release-signers file, so they cannot check
 * anything (and the code that would check is not in them either). The release that first brings the
 * file is the one trust-on-first-use step; a copy of THIS code with no key in the file says so in
 * the card instead of skipping in silence. Any line in the file that is not a comment counts as a
 * key, so a damaged file fails closed (ssh-keygen rejects it) rather than switching the check off.
 *
 * Once a key is in place, an unsigned, wrongly signed or uncheckable tag is refused: no merge,
 * nothing in the app folder changed, and the reason is in the card, in Settings > About, in
 * updater.log and in quartz.log. A git or ssh-keygen too old or missing to check is said as exactly
