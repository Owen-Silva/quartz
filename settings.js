 * settings.js — the settings instrument: a nav-row gear beside the theme
 * toggle, and a glass popover holding everything the browser lets you change.
 *
 * The renderer runs with contextIsolation ON and nodeIntegration OFF, so this
 * is plain browser script: no require(), no import, no bundler. Loaded after
 * app.js (whose top-level function declarations — setTheme, getActiveTab,
 * readCurrentUrl — are therefore global by the time anything here runs).
 *
 * WHAT IS PERSISTED. One JSON object in localStorage['settings']:

 *                                           // null = keywords.js's built-ins
 *     homepage:     'newtab',
 *     claudeDir:    null | absolute path,   // Claude pane's folder; null = home

 *                   // prefs survive; 'wallpaper'/'board'/'aurora' read as

 *                     files: [{ path, name }], shuffle } }
 *
 * THE NEW TAB'S PICTURE IS NOT IN THERE. kind 'image' needs a photo, and a
 * 2560px JPEG as base64 is about a megabyte of string that localStorage would
 * rewrite on every unrelated write. The blob lives in IndexedDB instead —
 * db 'browser', store 'assets', key 'newtab-bg' — and Settings.background()
 * hands app.js the pair as { kind, dim, url?, fileName?, ... }. `rev` is
 * a stamp, so replacing the picture still counts as a change worth pushing.
 * imageRev / clipRev change only when the picture / the clip itself changes,
 * so backdrop.js re-blurs (and re-captures a clip's still) only then, never
 * for a dim change.
 *
 * THE PALETTE IS MIRRORED. `palette` also lives under its own localStorage
 * key ('palette', absent for the default aurora) because theme-boot.js has to
 * stamp <html data-palette> before the first paint, long before this file
 * parses. applyPalette() writes both, so the two never drift.
 *
 * THE STOCKS SECTION IS NOT IN THERE EITHER, and that one is a rule rather
 * than a tidiness: its Finnhub key lives in MAIN (stocks.js, in
 * <userData>/stocks.json, as `stocks.finnhubKey`) and never crosses back.
 * The pane asks window.api.stocks.describe() for { enabled, hasKey, keyMask,
 * symbols, … } and writes with setKey/setEnabled/setSymbols; a key in this
 * file's localStorage object would be a key any devtools console could read.
 *
 * Per-site CSS is NOT stored here: it belongs to window.SiteStyles, which
 * keeps its own localStorage key and pushes changes into open tabs itself.
 * This panel only draws it, and only when that module is present.
 *
 * Missing keys fall back to DEFAULTS, so an older stored object still reads.
 * `chips: null` means "never touched" — the new tab page shows its own list
 * until the first edit, which seeds from window.DEFAULT_CHIPS.
 *
 * Owned ids/classes (nothing else in the app may touch them):
 *   #settings (the nav button), #settings-panel (the popover, a direct child
 *   of <body> so it stacks over #views), #settings-toast, and every .set-*
 *   class inside them.
 *
 * MOTION. The chrome sits on a backdrop-filter, so every animated frame
 * re-blurs the pane behind it. Nothing here animates continuously: the toast
 * steps in and out in four frames and then holds still.

       'web:<slug>'      a site the browser presents as an app (webapps.js)
       'term:<program>'  a terminal tab

     and a pin may also be an OBJECT carrying options:

       { id, web: true }      the primary click opens the app's web form
       { id, native: true }   ...or opens the app's own window IN a tab

     Those are the only two options a pin carries, which is why the plain
     string stays the stored shape whenever both are off: an old string-only
     file reads back unchanged, and a session that never touches either option
     never grows an object. pinOptions()/setPinOption() are the way in and out
     of it, and setPinOption() takes either key on its own. The two are
     exclusive — a press cannot both open the web form and host the window —
     so turning one ON clears the other, while turning one OFF leaves the
     other exactly where it was.

  /* ============================================================
     Typing — autocorrect, the red underline, and what they leave alone

     LIKE STOCKS, NOTHING HERE IS IN localStorage. Main owns the spelling
     state (it is the process that holds the dictionary and answers every
     tab), so this section draws whatever window.api.spell last said and
     sends every change back over it. Every call answers the whole
     SpellState, so one taker draws all three fields.

     LIVE WHILE THE PANE IS OPEN. "Add to dictionary" and "Autocorrect off on
     this site" happen in a PAGE's right-click menu, i.e. somewhere else; the
     list here has to grow while you watch, not on the next open. So
     openPanel() takes one onChanged subscription plus one state() read and
     closePanel() gives the subscription back, the same as the Phone rows.

     A PUSH MUST NOT MOVE YOU. Every render empties and refills the three
     fields, which would take focus (and a half-typed word) with it. So each
     focusable thing carries a data-spell-key; the render remembers which one
     had focus and hands it back, and the add field's text lives in spDraft
     rather than in the DOM. The fold is never touched: only the field bodies
     are rebuilt, the section and its heading stay put.

     NEVER SILENT. No bridge, a state() that rejects, a write that fails, or
     main saying the dictionary is unavailable: each one puts a sentence IN
     the section saying what is wrong and why, not only a toast or a log.

     ever holds the Finnhub key. So there is no DEFAULTS entry, no set({…})
     and no `get()` below — the state is whatever describe() last said, and
     every write goes out over window.api.stocks and comes back as the same
     shape. That is the same arrangement the Spotify rows have with the
     bridge, and for a stronger reason: a key in this file's localStorage
     object would be a key any devtools console could read.

     THE KEY ONLY EVER GOES ONE WAY. describe() answers `hasKey` and a
     `keyMask` ('••••4f21'), never the key. So the field is NEVER pre-filled:
     the mask is placeholder text, typing replaces the key, and the eye
     reveals only what has just been typed — a saved key cannot be shown
