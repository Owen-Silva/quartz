 * Keep the browser out of the Windows media session (SMTC).
 *
 * The idle music lives in the CHROME, in one <audio> element, and Chromium
 * registers that element with Windows as "now playing" for this app. The Spotify
 * bridge's /now reports whatever Windows calls the current session -- so the
 * music announced ITSELF as the machine playing something, music.js read its own
 * sound as the veto, paused, the session went Paused, the veto cleared, it
 * resumed, and round again every ~4 s. Measured on the live browser: the
 * auto-generated session titled "Browser" flipped Playing 13.7-15.7s,
 * Paused 16.2-17.3s, Playing 17.8-19.8s while Spotify sat Paused throughout.
 *
 * Turning HardwareMediaKeyHandling off removes this process from SMTC entirely,
 * which is the whole fix: nothing the browser plays can be mistaken for another
 * app. The price, deliberately paid: the media keys no longer control browser
 * tabs (they go to Spotify), and the Windows / new-tab now-playing tile shows
 * Spotify and other apps but never a browser tab.
 */

 * MediaFoundationCameraUsageMonitoring: the camera service must be able to go
 * away again.
 *
 * Chromium starts a "video_capture" utility the first time any page asks
 * about cameras -- one navigator.mediaDevices.enumerateDevices() is enough, and
 * Gmail and Gemini both make that call on load without ever opening a camera.
 * The service is built to exit five seconds after its last client leaves. This
 * feature keeps it from ever doing so: it parks a Media Foundation watcher in
 * the service (to learn when OTHER apps grab the camera), and a process that
 * has already loaded Media Foundation and the GPU driver (igc64.dll alone is
 * an 84 MB image) is expensive to keep for nothing. Measured 2026-09-26
 * on a test copy (RAM round): one enumerateDevices() in a Wikipedia tab and
 * the utility sat at 67.7 MB private for as long as we watched (minutes; the
 * live browser had carried its 68 MB since boot). With this off, the same call
 * still lists audioinput/videoinput/audiooutput, the utility comes up, answers
 * and is gone within 5 s; repeat enumerations stay at 0-1 ms because the
 * browser caches the device list (MediaDevicesSystemMonitorCaching, left on).
 *
 * Nothing in this app reads "the camera is busy in another app" -- that watcher
 * is its only job -- so turning it off loses no feature. The price is on the
 * camera path only: a page that opens the camera after the service has exited
 * pays the service launch again (the first open of a run always paid it).
 * Measured with Chromium's fake camera on the CPU-capped test copy: getUserMedia
 * to first frame 122-131 ms with the service warm, 329 ms and 1344 ms cold. A
 * real webcam spends ~0.5-1 s powering up on top of either.

 * of the player response. On a full document load that lands before the player
 * exists and YouTube copes. After an IN-PAGE click there is no new document:
 * the SPA asks for the next video over the fetch the scriptlet has patched,
 * gets a rewritten body back, and the player never initialises -- ytd-player is
 * in the DOM, #movie_player is not, and no <video> is ever created. Reloading
 * the same URL plays it, which is exactly the "it only loads once I reload"
 * this was reported as. Some of those injections also lose the race against the
 * navigation and reject ("Script failed to execute"), so how much of the
 * response got rewritten differs from load to load.
 *
 * Measured live (port 9441, in-page clicks from a search results page, 20 s a
 * round): stock = 0 of 5 rounds played; exceptions for every URL the engine
 * blocked on the way = 0 of 3; @@||youtube.com^$document = 0 of 3; blocking off
 * altogether = 3 of 3; scriptlets off for youtube.com = 5 of 5. So the cosmetic
 * scriptlets are the cause, not the cancelled requests.
 *
 * Only the scriptlets go. The cosmetic CSS still hides the ad shelves and every
 * network rule still blocks, so ad DELIVERY is no less blocked than before --
 * an in-stream ad can still play, which the reload path already did too.
 *
 * x.com and twitter.com are here for the same failure, on the same mechanism.
 * X's login is a same-document SPA: typing a username POSTs to
 * /i/api/1.1/onboarding/task.json over window.fetch, reads the next step out
 * of the JSON that comes back, and repeats for the password and for any
 * verification step. json-prune / replace-fetch-response / prevent-xhr patch
 * exactly that fetch and XMLHttpRequest, so an onboarding reply comes back
 * with fields rewritten or missing and the flow dead-ends -- "Could not log
 * you in now", a form that no longer responds, or a verification step that
 * never completes. There is no document load to reload past, which is why X

//      has not: the window he is typing into is INSIDE it.
//   2. Keystrokes go to the app, not to Chromium, so the browser's own
//      shortcuts are dead until the tab strip is clicked.
//
// embed.focusInfo() answers (1) from Win32 (see embed.js), and a 250 ms poll --
// running ONLY while something is actually hosted -- pushes the answer to the
// chrome as `embed:focus`. (2) is answered by handing a SMALL set of accelerators
// to the OS with globalShortcut, and only for exactly as long as a hosted app

 * Electron's WebContents.executeJavaScript waits for a guest that is still
 * loading by adding its own once('did-stop-loading') listener PER CALL. The
 * chrome pushes a dozen things into a fresh new tab (readout, stats, markets,
 * background, settings...) before it has finished loading, so the 11th call
 * tripped Node's leak warning. It was never a leak (each listener fires once
 * and goes), but the warning fired on every new tab and buried real ones.
 *
 * A first version shared ONE wait per load among the calls; it changed WHEN
 * some pushes landed (bravesearch-e2e's "Next keeps the look" failed with it
 * and passed without), so Electron's own waits are left exactly as they are.
 * Instead the limit makes room for them: just before a call, if Electron's
 * once() could be the one over the line, the limit goes up by 10; once the
 * page stops loading and the waits have drained it goes back to what it was.
 * So a guest still warns for any OTHER listener that piles up, at the usual
 * limit, every moment it is not mid-load with pushes queued.
 *
 * The <webview> element's executeJavaScript reaches this object by a method
 * lookup on the guest, so an own property here is what it calls.
